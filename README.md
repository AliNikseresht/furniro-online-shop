## Project Structure

The project structure follows best practices for a scalable and maintainable Next.js application. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the important parts:

- **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components like buttons, product cards, headers, footers, etc.
- **`services/`**: Contains functions for interacting with external services, such as making API requests to the Strapi backend.
- **`store/`**: Contains Redux slices and state management logic using Redux Toolkit.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/furniro-store.git
   cd furniro-store

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the development server:

   npm run dev

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

### Adding Products to Cart

Users can select products and add them to their cart. The cart data is managed through Redux and is accessible from any page in the application. Once products are added to the cart, users can proceed to checkout.

### Search Functionality

The search feature allows users to search for products by name, category, or other attributes. The results are dynamically fetched and displayed as the user types in the search bar.

### Favorites

Users can add products to their favorites list, which can be accessed from the user's profile page. This allows users to easily access products they are interested in purchasing later.

### Responsive Design

The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Backend (Strapi)

The backend is powered by **Strapi**, which serves as the content management system (CMS) for managing products, categories, and other dynamic content. Strapi exposes RESTful APIs to the frontend, making it easy to fetch and display data.

### Setting Up Strapi

To set up Strapi locally:

1. Clone the Strapi repository:

   git clone https://github.com/strapi/strapi.git
   cd strapi

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the Strapi server:

   npm run develop

4. The Strapi admin panel will be available at `http://localhost:1337/admin`, where you can manage products and other content.
